This app is build so that the archive data downloaded from Slack which is in the form of JSON files
can be parsed and then a new format created so that user can read it.

 To download the archive file from Slack, go to  https://slack.com/archives and then click Export Data.
 It might take a while. You have to be the admin user, creator of the group.

 Note:
 To display emoticons, a folder with all emoticons ("Graphics") has to be copied to the output folder path
