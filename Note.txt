This app is build so that the archive data downloaded from Slack which is in the form of JSON files
can be parsed and then a new format created so that user can read it.

To download the archive file from Slack, go to  https://slack.com/archives and then click Export Data.
It might take a while. You have to be the admin user, creator of the group.

Created .NetCore version of console application. Since many code is similar and Lib project(.NET Standard project) cannot be referenced by the windows
form application. The similar classes are added as link in windows form project.


To display emoticons, a folder with all emoticons ("Graphics") has to be copied to the output folder path

Code logic:

- To have the download files be unique as two files may have same name, we rename the downloaded file as "FileID_FileName"
